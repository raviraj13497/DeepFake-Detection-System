# DeepFake-Detection-System

Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust Deepfake Detection system, capable of distinguishing between real and manipulated video content. With the rise of AI-generated deepfakes, ensuring the authenticity of multimedia has become crucial. This project utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to analyze video frames and identify subtle inconsistencies that indicate tampering.

Key Features

	•	Frame-by-Frame Analysis: Detects deepfakes by analyzing individual frames of a video.
	•	CNN and LSTM Models: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial features and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal dependencies.
	•	Dataset: Trained on large-scale datasets of real and fake videos to ensure high accuracy.
	•	Performance Metrics: Provides detailed metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to evaluate the model’s performance.
	•	User-Friendly Interface: Simple interface for uploading videos and viewing detection results.

Technologies Used

	•	Python
	•	TensorFlow / PyTorch
	•	OpenCV
